# Github Classroom Issue Creator

I work as TA with Prof. Andrew King.
Course is a programming intensive.

Starting Fall 2020 Prof wants to introduce the course on Github Classroom for multiple reasons.

While setting up the assignments we realized that we cannot share "issues" in the repos that students clone from base repo.

We can ofcourse create issue manually on the student repos. But doing it on so many students' repo would be a nightmare for TA's and Prof.
So I have created a pyton script that uses GitHub API's to do it on a single button press.
